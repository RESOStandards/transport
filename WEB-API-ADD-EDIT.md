# Web API Add/Edit Endorsement

This endorsement is a work in progress for 2022. It is based on the original RCP-010 proposal by Sergio Del Rio and was previously adopted into DRAFT 
status by the RESO Transport Workgroup for Web API 1.1.0.

Note that some requirements have been removed from the original proposal, specifically child order action and async operations. 
Providers MAY implement these items but they will not be tested for version 2.1.0 of this endorsement. 

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/RESOStandards/web-api-commander/discussions/64) for proposed testing rules.
