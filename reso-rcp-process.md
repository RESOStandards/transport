# RESO Change Proposal (RCP) Process

## New Change Proposals
1. Make a post on [**GitHub Discussions**](https://github.com/RESOStandards/transport/discussions). This should contain a summary of the business case, list of requirements, and initial proposal.
2. Request that the topic be added to the Transport Workgroup agenda by emailing transport@reso.org at least two weeks before the meeting in which it's to be discussed. Ideally, there should be activity in the GitHub Discussion prior to the workgroup meeting. 
3. Once thereâ€™s consensus in the group to move a given item forward, [**an issue should be created**](https://github.com/RESOStandards/transport/issues/new) with a preliminary set of testing rules that could be used to (unambiguously) build software with, when applicable.
4. A draft specification should be created. [**See instructions**](./proposals/).

## Draft Specification and Testing Rules
1. The workgroups will review the draft specification.
2. The proposal will stay in draft status until it has at least two implementations from two separate vendors.
3. Implementations must be verified against the proposed testing rules by RESO staff, even if on a development server. Contact dev@reso.org for verification.
4. Once implementations have been verified, the proposal will be approved by the Certification Subgroup and sent to Transport for final approval. Keep in mind that additional changes may be requested by the community before proceeding.

## Approval and Adoption Phase
1. At this point, the RCP is ready for approval by the Transport Workgroup. If the change proposal is based on an existing specification, Transport will decide which version of the specification the changes will apply to. [**Transport Versioning Policy**](https://transport.reso.org/versioning).
2. There may also be a motion to create certification tools and potentially new reports or metrics. These items will be added to RESO's backlog, once approved.
3. A motion and second will be made to adopt the specification. 
4. If testing tools are to be created, that work must be complete before ratification. 
5. The proposal will be sent to the RESO Board of Directors to be ratified if the RCP has a major change, otherwise it will be released after Transport approves it and any related testing tools are ready.
